<h2>Asteroid Defense</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The cowboy asteroids are coming towards Earth. Aim the NASA cannon to destroy at least 50 of them!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
It mostly involves asteroids but has a hint of cowboy.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game is of the hectic space clicker variety.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The experience should be simple but more engaging and difficult as the game goes on. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player uses the mouse to target the NASA cannon. By clicking on an asteroid, it is destroyed.
That is essentially the entire game. Asteroids will speed up as they are destroyed. The game ends
once 50 asteroids have been destroyed. If you cannot take 50 of them down, you will be left in space forever at your post. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Sprite manipulation and some other basic concepts. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
My art is unique.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are at NASA command of their new proton cannon. A swarm of engineered cowboy asteroids 
are hurdling towards Earth. If you don't destroy 50 of them, they will impact with enough 
force to end all life on our planet. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
No one knows how these asteroids were engineered. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone can play this game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
About 20 seconds. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Clicking very fast. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<li>Background: <a href="http://nightmaremetropolis.deviantart.com/art/800x600-Stars-191033732">Stars by NightmareMetropolis</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I didn't use a game example from phaser, but I looked at their image rendering code, their sprite
code and multiple sprite code, I looked up some Phaser physics functions, and I looked at some
simple time functions.
