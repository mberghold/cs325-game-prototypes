<h2>What's Your Deal?</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Player and computer pick card values to win turn by turn.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I think I made my own theme. 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Mouse input and one key on the keyboard, Part deterministic, part random, card game
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should have an engaging time determining what is the optimal cards to play at any given time. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The core mechanic is choosing a card. This is done by clicking on the cards on the screen. You can press I for instructions. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The card vs card gameplay feature. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
I think it's never been made before, at least to my knowledge. It's kind of like war but with some strategy.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are in a card game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
No story really. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I think anyone could enjoy playing this. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than five minutes. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I'm not really sure yet, I've tried a lot of different things but I haven't found any strategies yet. For example, I
dont know if picking into ties are optimal or not. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Playing card images taken from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimedia</a></li>
<li>Pings taken from <a href="https://notificationsounds.com/message-tones/">notificationsounds</a></li>
<li>All other artwork is my own.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.

<li>Iterating my first sequence:</li>
<li>My feedback was essentially to add more audio and visual feedback. To accomplish this, I added soundbytes to certain actions, such as picking the beginning four cards, making the game board, resuslt of the round, and result of the game. On the visual side I wasn't too sure what I could do so during rounds I had cards fade out instead of immediately disappear. One key update I made was displaying the random card on the deck and then fading it out so that they player could see easily what random card they played. 

To iterate more I wanted to add effects to the cards and make it harder for the player. I basically just redid the scoring system making it more complicated and trying to add in pushback effects if you were losing or winning badly. I added another keyboard acitavated panel to show the new card values.</li>
