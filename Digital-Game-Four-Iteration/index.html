<h2>Elephant Hero</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Poachers are trying to kill elephants for their ivory! Send them to their maker!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Preservationist.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard, more randomness, shooter, and achiever?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
They will be happy to see the animals and stressed when trying to defend them. Ultimately victory will bring great pride but defeat will bring great sorrow. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player is the guardsman located on the left of the screen. Below him is the elephant that must be protected. Above is a cat creature just watching. The player uses the up and down arrow keys to aim their pistol, and spacebar to shoot. The poachers will run at the elephant and the player must shoot them before they reach it. The poachers get progressively faster as the game goes on.

Aiming with arrow keys.
