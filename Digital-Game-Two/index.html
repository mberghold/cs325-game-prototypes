<h2>Organ Retrieval</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
An organ donor has just come in... we must save his organs.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Organ Donor
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: mouse and clickable buttons
Randomness: deterministic
Genre: puzzle?
Playstyle: explorer?
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player will have a fun but slightly stressful experience as they try to win the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player is a doctor performing an autopsy on a dead person. You can see the hands of the doctor, who is holding some scissors and a scalpal. By clicking on the body, the doctor can make an incision. Clicking on an incision closes it up. If the doctor has cut in the right spot, one of the organs will appear. He must click and drag it above the organs bin. If he closes the incision before taking the organ or the organ falls off the table, the game is lost. Also, if over 10 incisions are made, the game is lost. The game is won by finding and collecting all three organs.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Searching for something and clicking and dragging. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The artwork is unique. I think it's a interesting spin on operation. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a doctor in the surgery area with a person who has just passed away. They were an organ donor, so you must try to save the three organs present. Don't mess up!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is not much story beyond the setting/premise and the gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People interested in playing a quick and relatively easy game that has great artwork.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Roughly 20 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
You must click around in a grid so as not to waste all of your incisions finding the organs. Then you must not let go of the organs as you move them to the organs bin.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>All artwork was my own.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.

My game most closely resembles Operation I think.

I looked at several Phaser examples, namely gravity, collision, buttons, and input clicking.
